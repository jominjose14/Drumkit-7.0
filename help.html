  <p>
    This drumkit can be played in two ways:
    <ul>
      <li>Mouse/Touch</li>
      <li style="text-align: left;">Keyboard</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Mouse-Clicks/Touch</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>In the first case, click or touch on the letter-buttons located next to each drum part to play it. Its as simple as that! Make sure you enable multi-touch in case of a touch-screen.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Keyboard</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>In the second case, before using the keyboard to play, check out the [Controls] page to understand the default key-bindings. The chosen keys are shown on the letter-buttons next to each drum-part. Press the linked up key on the keyboard to play the corresponding drum-part.</p>
  <p>Enjoy!</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Coming Feature</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>The feature of changing the default control keys to any key that the user likes, will soon be available. The [Update Controls] button is part of this feature. As of now, this button is not functional. DrumKit 7.0 remains under construction ;)</p>
